# Yale School of Art: Redesign project 🎨
### Course: Human-computer interaction (HCI)


## 📝 Project description
This project presents a comprehensive **UI/UX transformation** of the Yale school of art website. The redesign shifts the interface from a chaotic "wiki-style" layout to a **modern, professional, and responsive** academic portal, strictly adhering to HCI usability standards.

## 🧐 Core challenges (Before) ⚠️
*The original site was evaluated and found to have 8 major usability disadvantages:*

1. **Lack of visual hierarchy** 📉: No clear distinction between primary and secondary information.
2. **Visual noise** 🔊: Distracting backgrounds and cluttered elements creating a confusing experience.
3. **Poor navigation** 🧭: A weak navigation system making it difficult to find essential sections.
4. **Accessibility issues** ♿: Non-compliance with standard inclusive design guidelines.
5. **Not responsive** 📱: The layout fails to adapt to mobile devices or different screen sizes.
6. **Lack of branding** 🏛️: Failure to reflect the official and prestigious identity of Yale university.
7. **Misleading links** 🔗: Elements that appear clickable but are non-functional or lead to wrong pages.
8. **Sacrificing functionality for "art"** 🎭: Prioritizing experimental aesthetics over basic usability.
